Console Helper for .NET, Written in C#

You can use these helper classes to run console-based command-line utilities and capture their outputs. Currently there are two kinds of helpers, one uses Reactive-Extensions (Rx) to report the output. Other uses async tasks. I am still in the process of improving the functionality. Feel free to make suggestions.
